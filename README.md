code:

tested in postman.

endpoints:
  GET - https://t7tcx119w1.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/test/functions
  PUT - https://t7tcx119w1.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/test/functions/{id}
functions:
  list: assignment3-test-list
  delete: assignment3-test-delete


upload a file by running upload.js <file path> (i did it in windows cmd, eg >node upload.js images/drawing.png)

this should return something like 
```
Upload Success https://minidrop.s3.amazonaws.com/drawing.png
{ TableName: 'minidboxTable',
  Item:
   { id: 'drawing.png',
     location: 'https://minidrop.s3.amazonaws.com/drawing.png',
     timestamp: 'Wed Mar 21 2018 22:03:40 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)',
     delState: 0 } }
```
this uploads a file to an s3 bucket while also writing the entry to a dynamodb table. table content can be checked by sending a GET request to the aforementioned endpoint.

delete an item by sending a PUT request with the object id (reused file name in this case); the object will be deleted from the s3 bucket (you can check this by going to the location url in a browser,  it will return an access denied error because the file doesn't exist anymore)

the associated entry in the dynamodb table will not be deleted, but it will be updated so the delState = 1 and location url removed.
